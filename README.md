# Yoga Pose Memory Matcher Game

Pseudocode for the overall gameplay:
- When I load the page, I see a start button that says Click to Play.
- I click the button and 25 cards appear on the page, 5 across and 5 down. A timer appears at the top of the page and starts ticking up from 00:00.
- I click on one card and it flips over, revealing an image of a yoga pose.
- I click on another card, revealing the name of a yoga pose.
- The name does not match the image and the cards flip back over.
- I click on the same first card and a different second card.
- They match and stay turned over.
- I continue clicking on card to turn them over, trying to match them.
- If the timer hits 5 minutes before I have matched all of the cards, I get a "Game Over" message on the screen.
- If I match all of the cards before the timer hits 5 minutes, a "You Win!" message appears on the screen.
